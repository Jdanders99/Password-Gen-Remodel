# Password Generator Remodel

## Description
Was designed so that users can create a functional password, based on input such as how long they want it and if it includes capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Allows users to generate unique passwords that can be used for whatever they desire. I learned that it makes for mindless password creation, but make sure to save it or write it down somehwere so you don't forget!

## Usage
Used to help generate a password that users can make their own by choice of how long or short (between 8 and 128 characters) they would like the password to be, and other functions such of what type of characters to include!
